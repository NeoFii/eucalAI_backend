## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity (10 phases) — split infra into scaffold + DB, domain into models + controllers, relay into core + adapters, deploy into testing + cutover
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (Admin) can parallel Phase 4 (User) — both depend only on Phase 3
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (Inference) can parallel Phase 7 (Protocol) — both depend only on Phase 6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 3 (relay core) needs deeper research on call_lifecycle 6-phase circuit breakers
- [Research]: Phase 10 needs environment validation for DB merge procedure
